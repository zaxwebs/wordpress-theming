# Basic Concepts
* **Theme** - In WordPress, a theme is a collection of templates and stylesheets used to define the appearance and display of a WordPress powered website.
* **Starter Theme** - A WordPress starter theme is a blank theme with minimum design, and a basic or absolutely no layout. These themes usually come with the most commonly used templates in a WordPress theme.
* **Parent Theme** - A parent theme in WordPress is a theme that is declared parent by a another theme, child theme. This feature in WordPress allows theme designers and developers to take advantage of a larger and robust WordPress themes and make modifications to those themes by creating child themes.
* **Child Theme** - A child theme in WordPress is a sub theme that inherits all the functionality, features, and style of its parent theme.
* **Child vs Starter Theme** - Create a child theme when you need to edit an exisiting theme & you want to save the changes on (parent) theme update. Use a starter theme when you want to create a new theme with some of the features, structure & code already set up.
