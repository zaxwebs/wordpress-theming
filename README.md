## Development
* [Theme Check](https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/) - The theme check plugin is an easy way to test your theme and make sure it’s up to spec with the latest theme review standards
* [Query Monitor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/query-monitor/) - Query Monitor is the developer tools panel for WordPress. It enables debugging of database queries, PHP errors, hooks and actions, block editor blocks, enqueued scripts and stylesheets, HTTP API calls, and more.
* [WP Reset](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-reset/) - WP Reset quickly resets the site’s database to the default installation values without modifying any files. It deletes all customizations and content, or just chosen parts like theme settings.
